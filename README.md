# Location-based Recommender Systems
Basics of Recommender Systems: Study of Location-Based Social Networks

# Description
This is a simple tutorial to explore the basic of recommender systems. Here, we implemented three basic methods in recommender system, __User-based Collaborative Filtering__, __Item-based Collaborative Filtering__, and __Sigular Value Decomposition (SVD)__.

## Notebooks
We have two Jupyter notebooks, [Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/rahmanidashti/LRSbasics/blob/master/Data%20Preprocessing.ipynb) and [Recommender Systems Algorithms](https://github.com/rahmanidashti/LRSbasics/blob/master/Recommender%20Systems%20Algorithms.ipynb). In the first one, we read the dataset and preprocess it. Then, in [Recommender Systems Algorithms](https://github.com/rahmanidashti/LRSbasics/blob/master/Recommender%20Systems%20Algorithms.ipynb), we implement the basic methods and compare them.

## Dataset
The dataset collect from the [Foursqaure](https://foursquare.com/about) by the following paper. The `dataset` folder includes the original dataset and `preprocessed_data` includes the dataset after pre-processing. The dataset has `2321` users, `5596` locations (POIs), and `151589` check-ins.

## PDFs
We put the PDF version of the notebooks in the `PDFs` folder.
